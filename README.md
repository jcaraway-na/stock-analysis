# Green-Stock Analysis

### BACKGROUND

> Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

The analysis below will provide insight into the following:
- DevOps team to clean up legacy code for improved run times to handle larger datasets.
- The main purpose of this refactor is to make the VBA code more efficient with larger datasets.

### OBJECTIVE

- DELIVERABLE 1: Please see attached Refactored VBA Code for the Green-Stocks Analyzer.
- DELIVERABLE 2: Release notes over review of the refactored code compaired to legacy code.
